      <h2>Iron Man</h2>

      <p>A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and

      ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest

      injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build

      a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor

      to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit,

      adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his

      company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to

      protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true

      identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.</p>

      <h2>Thor</h2>

      <p>Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, the former king of Asgard and

      New Asgard, and a founding member of the Avengers. When his irresponsible

      and impetuous behavior reignited a conflict between Asgard and Jotunheim,

      Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power, and

      banished to Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth, Thor learned humility,

      finding love with Jane Foster, and helped save his new friends from the

      Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act of sacrifice, Thor redeemed

      himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which he

      then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide</p>

      <h2>Captain America</h2>

      <p>Captain Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers is a World War II veteran, a founding

      member of the Avengers, and Earth's first known superhero. Rogers grew up

      uffering from numerous health problems, and upon America's entry into

      World War II, he was rejected from serving in the United States Army

      despite several attempts to enlist. Rogers ultimately volunteered for

      Project Rebirth, where he was the only recipient of the Super Soldier

      Serum developed by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic Scientific Reserve.

      The serum greatly enhanced Rogers' physical abilities to superhuman levels.

      After Erskine's assassination and being doubted by SSR head director

      Chester Phillips, Rogers was relegated to performing in war bond

      campaigns, where he posed as a patriotic mascot under the moniker

      of Captain America.</p>

      <h2>Hulk</h2>

      <p>Robert Bruce Banner, M.D., Ph.D., is a renowned scientist and a founding

      member of the Avengers. As someone who was highly respected for his work

      regarding biochemistry, nuclear physics, and gamma radiation, he was

      commissioned by Thaddeus Ross to recreate the Super Soldier Serum which

      created Captain America, although Ross elected not to inform Banner what

      he was creating. However, when an exposure to high levels of gamma radiation

      instead of vita radiation went awry, the mild-mannered scientist had found

      that when angered, provoked or excited, he would transform into the huge,

      rage-fueled, nearly mindless creature known as Hulk.</p>

      <h2>Black Widow</h2>

      <p>Natalia Alianovna "Natasha" Romanoff, also known as Black Widow, was one

      of the most talented spies and assassins in the entire world and a founding

      member of the Avengers. Originally a KGB operative and dangerous assassin,

      Romanoff was recruited into S.H.I.E.L.D. by Clint Barton. Having extensive

      mastery in martial arts and armed with her Widow's Bite, Black Widow

      became one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most efficient agents. During one mission,

      she was sent undercover into Stark Industries to watch Tony Stark due to

      the fear that he was dying. During this mission, Romanoff assisted Stark

      with defeating Ivan Vanko's terrorist plots against him.</p>

      <h2>Hawk Eye</h2>

      <p>Clinton Francis "Clint" Barton, also known as Hawkeye, is a skilled marksman,

      a former special agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and one of the founding members of

      the Avengers. Known for his use of the bow and arrow as his primary weapon,

      Barton had become one of the best agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., responsible for

      the recruitment of Black Widow, whom he developed a strong friendship with.

     Assigned by Nick Fury into watching over the Tesseract, he was brainwashed

      by Loki and used as his pawn for all his evil schemes. However, following

      their Attack on the Helicarrier, he was freed from Loki's mental controls

      by Black Widow and joined the Avengers to fight against Loki's Chitauri

      army in the Battle of New York, ending Loki's Invasion, before Hawkeye had

      returned to his work as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.</p>
